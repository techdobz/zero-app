## 🔒 What Is Zero?

Zero gives you your own encrypted database vaults — perfect for:

- Passwords and login credentials  
- Metadata or structured personal info  
- Private notes, OTPs, backups  
- Journals, research, or code snippets  
- Local-first, zero-trust storage

> Everything stays on your machine. You decrypt only when you want to.
